# kpmpc

This program is really unfinished, I started rewriting it.

This program requires a ~/.kpmpcrc, the defaults are in ./default.kpmpcrc

It also requires a ~/.local/share/kpmpc/arial.ttf which alos has to be manually installed.

## Configuration

Configuration is in the file ~/.kpmpcrc, the defaults template configuration is in ./default.kpmpcrc.

### Configuration options

\# <comment/annotations> -- Specifies a string of commands that will be automatically performed when the program is started

do <string of commands> -- Specifies a string of commands that will be automatically performed when the program is started

map <\a string of commands> <\a string of commands that the previous string of commands would be remapped to>
